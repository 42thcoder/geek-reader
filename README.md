# Geek Reader

This is yet another online feed reader. http://geek-reader.com
The unique things about Geek Reader is its functions are designed towards geek readers.

Here I name a few:

### Custom Stylesheets
User can set and edit stylesheet for each feed source. This can greatly improve the reading experience.

### Secondary Fetching
It support secondary fetching. For sites like Hacker News, the feed source doesn't supply any meaningful text content. Geek Reader will fetch it from the given link and merge it with the feed.

### Code highlighting
[Hightlight.js](http://highlightjs.org/) is used to highlight source code. Users can choose the color scheme for rendering.

### Custom Feed Builder
(planned)

Besides, here are some standard features.

1. Optimized UI for easy reading 
1. Search in subscriptions
1. Automatic updates on subscriptions
1. Email notifications

Stack used:

1. BackboneJS
